# SpaceLords_V0.01

Space lords V0.01 is a demo version for a videogame centered around building and desiging spaceships to battle and conquer space.

Hire mercenaries, earn bounties, and conquer systems. We plan to make Play-2-Earn mechanics with NFTs.


Here is the first iteration of this project, non-nft version. This is not by any means a finished product as this game is in active development.
